[04:58:59] So I can see how loud you are. [04:59:00] What did you eat for breakfast this morning? [04:59:02] I’m serious I want to see how loud you are. [04:59:05] What did you eat?

Athlete
[04:59:06] I don’t know nothing like I haven't ate at all.

Interviewer
[04:59:08] What did you do when you got up?

Athlete
[04:59:10] Well take a shower. [04:59:12] I brush my teeth. [04:59:15] And I got ready.

Interviewer
[04:59:17] Ok. [04:59:18] Tell me about when you first started training parkour, you know, what it is like, how hard it was just things like that and say and start the phrase just say, "when I first started parkour” and just...

Athlete
[04:59:31] Well when I first started doing parkour that was five years ago. [04:59:35] Shoud I say that?

Interviewer
[04:59:36] That’s fine.

Athlete
[04:59:37] I started doing… when I first started doing parkour it was five years ago and I was doing just some small little jumps. [04:59:45] Watching videos of others and blowing my mind that some people can jump so far and do all these awesome tricks but like through all these years doing it I became even better than them. [04:59:57] And like all the. [05:00:00] I realized that there's no limits. [05:00:02] All limits are inside your head. [05:00:05] So.

Interviewer
[05:00:07] That's good. [05:00:09] Tell me about like when you were first learning what was hard? [05:00:12] What were your struggles? [05:00:13] What were you discouraged? [05:00:15] Tell me what you were thinking.

Athlete
[05:00:18] So when I when I first started it like... [05:00:24] Let me think of something. [05:00:25] Hold on.

Interviewer
[05:00:27] Tell me this first. [05:00:29] Tell me that, like you're from Bosnia, so you can say that’s what people when they hear your accent they’ll say OK whatever and just tell me you know about being... [05:00:39] Did you start when you were in Bosnia?

Athlete
[05:00:40] Can I say like when I was in Bosnia they didn’t have a lot of opportunities. [05:00:45] Once I came here….

Interviewer
[05:00:46] Yes, that's perfect.

Athlete
[05:00:56] Well when I was in Bosnia I started doing parkour and I had a lot of struggle learning stuff and we didn't have gyms or nothing but since I moved here to the United States I discovered Above All, and Above All help me a lot with learning my flips, progressed a lot and coming to the point where I wanted to be.

Interviewer
[05:01:19] That’s awesome. [05:01:20] Tell me how... [05:01:23] tell me about training indoors with pads and all that. [05:01:26] Is it helpful? [05:01:27] What does it help you do?

Athlete
[05:01:29] Well training indoors is a lot more helpful just because I can try things with no... [05:01:39] Indoor is a lot more easier for me to train because with knowing that I cannot get injured and I can try those things and once I learned the feeling on how to flips feel then I can bring that outside and I have less difficulty doing it.

Interviewer
[05:01:56] That's awesome. [05:01:58] Tell me about what are some of your goals for yourself in parkour? [05:02:02] And like what are the goals that you've set? [05:02:04] And you've already like reach them and then what are some things that you want to do what you are learning still? [05:02:11] Tell me about like a goal that you had, that you wanted to be able to do, that you've already accomplished in parkour. [05:02:18] And then tell me about a goal where you see yourself or what you want to reach, like a level you know — just talk about your goals with parker. [05:02:34] Maybe like, "when I first started I had a very simple goal of blank, but now that I'm you know...".

Athlete
[05:02:44] I when I first started I had a goal of doing double side to sides, that was like one of the biggest things I always wanted to do. [05:02:52] Above All gave me the opportunity to try a double sides on trampoline into foam pit. [05:02:58] Later on I started doing them outside and I was really happy. [05:03:03] Now I'm trying to do double backflips and I've been practicing a lot at Above All.

Interviewer
[05:03:14] Tell me about where do you see yourself? [05:03:18] Is there a goal like Red Bull or you know world championships or anything like that in the future that you want to reach?

Athlete
[05:03:28] Well I always wanted to go to Red Bull Art of Motion, which is the biggest parkour and freerunning event. [05:03:43] Always wanted to go to Red Bull Art of Motion which is the biggest parkour and freerunning event in the world which has people around the world who are competing against each other. [05:03:55] But it's not as much as a competition as much as it's how hard can you push yourself. [05:04:01] How how much can you take on your body and break those limits?

Interviewer
[05:04:09] That's perfect. [05:04:11] I like what you were saying right there. [05:04:13] So talk a little bit about in your mind, when you're approaching parkour like what your mindset and what I mean most people think it's just crazy but why do you do it? [05:04:25] Why do you love it? [05:04:26] Talk about what goes on in your mind when you do parker.

Athlete
[05:04:30] The only reason I love Parkour is just because it helps me with everyday life is it makes me break my mental blocks which is things that I want to do, but I’m kind of scared of. [05:04:44] But parkour helps me with breaking that limit and go further beyond that. [05:04:49] So is usually when I'm trying to do really hard trick, I would like just calm down my body picture myself breathe in breathe out three times and just go for it with with meaning towards me accomplish what I'm doing.

Interviewer
[05:05:08] That's awesome. [05:05:10] What is that feeling like when you see it and then like you have to overcome the mental block and then eventually you convince yourself and you land — you stick the trick that you didn't think you could do. [05:05:19] What's that like?

Athlete
[05:05:21] Well once you decide what you're going to do and once you start running into it it's scary but you just gotta go and push. [05:05:33] And once you push it's the best feeling in the world. [05:05:35] You get happy. [05:05:37] You get really proud of yourself because you just break that wall that was right there and you can go break another one.

Interviewer
[05:05:46] That was perfect. [05:05:48] Say this phrase one time. [05:05:49] Just say, "once you land it you feel...”.

Athlete
[05:06:03] So once you jump and you land you get this feeling of... [05:06:22] So once you land it is a big relief knowing that you just broke that wall and you can always use the same feeling for another harder flip or another harder jump to remind yourself that you can do it.

Interviewer
[05:06:40] Awesome. [05:06:42] Just one little thing for this video... [05:06:44] Describe a little bit the process of how you progressed through a stunt like the run up and then like you don't do it completely but you feel you know the small motions that go into it. [05:06:56] Just talk a little bit about that.

Athlete
[05:06:57] Well progression is the main key towards success. [05:07:01] I will usually start if I'm trying to do a big jump I would keep jumping closer and closer to it. [05:07:09] And then once I would just stop for a minute calm my body down and just go for it. [05:07:16] So once you go for it there's no changing your mind. [05:07:19] You get a go for it and you will succeed.

Interviewer
[05:07:22] Perfect. [05:07:22] That leads me into the last thing, like what you just said at the end. [05:07:26] OK. [05:07:26] If there's a younger kid who's been watching all these videos and they want to be a parkour athlete what's your message to like kids who love parkour and want to do it, but you know they're not capable yet. [05:07:40] What do you what do you want to say to them?

Athlete
[05:07:42] Well my message to all the future athletes and future kids that are passion for parkour is to be safe, but to be in control of their own body which is... [05:07:57] let me think about this. [05:08:04] So my message for all future athletes and future kids trying to have. [05:08:12] My message for all the future athletes and for all the future kids that have passion for parkour is to be safe and to be in control of their bodies. [05:08:22] Not going too hard but also not going to soft. [05:08:25] Be in between. [05:08:26] And also the best way to learn is to go somewhere safe where you can start having the feelings so what you're doing. [05:08:35] That way once you get outside you know actually what you're doing and you can just go for it.

Interviewer
[05:08:39] That's awesome. [05:08:40] OK last statement. [05:08:41] Say my name's Armin Smyillovich. [05:08:46] I'm 19 years old and I train parkour at Above All. [05:08:56] Just a statement that kind of summarizes who you are what you do. [05:08:59] And just once.

Athlete
[05:09:02] My name is Armin Smyillovich. [05:09:04] I'm 19 year old. [05:09:05] I’ve been doing parkour and free running for five years now. [05:09:08] I’ve been in some competitions. [05:09:12] Right now I've been training a lot at Above All because it gives me a big opportunity of succeeding and I can...

Interviewer
[05:09:24] It's OK it's OK. [05:09:25] Let’s just make a statement. [05:09:28] It's simple.

Athlete
[05:09:38] My name is Armley Smajlovic I'm 19 years old and I train parkour at Above All.

Interviewer
[05:09:43] Perfect.
